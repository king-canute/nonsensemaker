## **Task: 1.1 - Project Initialization**

### Action Taken:
Opened a terminal session. Navigated to the designated project development directory. Executed the command `npm create astro@latest` to begin the project scaffolding process. Followed the interactive setup wizard prompts with the following selections: Project Template: **Empty**, Install Dependencies: **Yes**, Initialize Git Repository: **Yes**, TypeScript Configuration: **Strict**. Changed the current directory to the newly created project folder. Ran `npm run dev` to start the local development server and confirmed that the default Astro welcome page was accessible and rendering correctly in the browser. Staged all new files and created the initial commit using the command `git commit -m "feat: Initial project setup with Astro"`.

### Outcome:
The Astro project was successfully initialized, and the local development environment was verified. The initial state of the project has been committed to the local Git repository.

### Confirmation:
✅ **Acceptance Criteria Met:** A runnable, "hello world" Astro site now exists on the local machine and is committed to a Git repository.

## **Task: 2.3 - Dynamic Article Page Generation**

### Action Taken:
The User confirmed that the dynamic routing is now working correctly.
