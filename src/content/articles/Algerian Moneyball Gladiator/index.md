Maximus Decius Meridius. Father to a murdered son. Husband to a murdered wife. One of the best gladiators out there. We spoke to an expert Algerian gladiatorial analyst who said that he couldn't understand where he came from.

"It was honestly incredible", said Youssef bin Saied. "He outscored all of the metrics. He's good at stabbing with spears and with tiny little swords, and he's got chariot capability. You just don't get that in the modern game."

When asked what other gladiators he thought might be coming up through the ranks, Youssef said, "I've got my eye on this one kid. He's called Ouchius. He's got a bout next week against some no-name kid called Spartacus and he's a sure bet."
