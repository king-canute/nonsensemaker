## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
├── public/
├── src/
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

## **Task: 4.1 - Create Video Content Structure and Page**

### Action Taken:

Generated the necessary instructions and code for the User to add a new video section to the website. The provided assets include:
1.  **Prerequisite Instructions:** Clear steps for the User to create a new content directory (`src/content/videos/`) and a sample Markdown file (`sample-video.md`) containing frontmatter for video metadata like `title` and `youtubeId`.
2.  **New `src/pages/videos.astro`:** The complete code for a new page that uses `import.meta.glob` to fetch all video content. The page then dynamically renders each video's title, description, and an embedded YouTube `iframe` player. Responsive CSS for the video player is also included.

### Outcome:

The User has been provided with all necessary instructions and code to create a new, dynamic video gallery page.

### Confirmation:

✅ The provided code, if implemented correctly by the User, will satisfy all acceptance criteria for this task.

### Next Step:

Awaiting User confirmation of successful implementation.
